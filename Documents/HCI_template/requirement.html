							<p><strong>Affordances </strong></p>
							<p>As we mentioned in Domain and Context, the main goal of our website is to empower students at the University of Florida to understand what are communicable diseases and how to prevent them before they are contracted and to know what disease you have once it is already obtained to promote a speedy recovery. First, we talk about what are the affordances of our proposed solution and then we talk about the main components of our product. Finally, we investigate the functionalities and actions we consider to guarantee user needs are addressed.</p>
