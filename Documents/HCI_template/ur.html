                            <p><strong> Expert User </strong></p>
                            <p> This user is well aware of what communicable diseases are, from how they are spread to how they can be mitigated. A current challenge for this user is understanding when a sickness is more severe then what they might believe before it has progressed and placed this user in a critical state. Another challenge would be understanding what early symptoms are worth paying attention to which can distinguish what type of illness this might be.</p>
                            <p><strong>Attitude:</strong> These users are very health conscientious and do their best to remain healthy. They prefer to avoid hospitals if possible to avoid catching something while in the facility if they do not have a major problem.</p>

                            <p> This individual is unaware of the meaning behind the term communicable but understands that there are contagious diseases that spread from person to person. A challenge faced by the intermediate user is providing them with accurate information to disprove the myths they have been told concerning how to contract these diseases.</p>
                            <p><strong>Attitude:</strong> These users also like to be aware of their health, but sometimes they tend to lack maintaining a proper balance. Therefore, to help balance the scales they depend on other sources and individuals to fill in the blanks of their knowledge gaps.</p>

                            <p> This user is highly prone to constantly visit the doctor’s office, which wastes time and efficiency because they believe anything they find on the internet. The motto of this user is, “rather safe than sorry.” One of the key challenge faced by novice users is themselves.</p>

There is a reason why this world is filled with medical doctors and physicians that study the human body their entire lives, so these users will step back and let them do their job.</p>
